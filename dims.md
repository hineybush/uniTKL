Plu Dimensions:
size of PCB 122 * 345 mm , one or 2 mm more would not be a problem
size of plate 128 * 349 mm, the 128 should be rather precise cut

distance between:
ESC and F1: 38 mm
F9 to Pause/Break : 119 mm
ESC and Pause/Break : 328.5 mm
Pause/Break and Right Arrow: 104 mm
Distance between all the holes on the PCB for the supporting posts on the bottom of the keyboard case

I measuerd all holes from the middle of the hole.
All upper holes have the distance of 22.5mm from the upper edge of the PCB.
The distances of the upper 3 holes from left (CapsLock side) to the right side are:
left edge to 1st hole: 56mm, 1st hole to 2nd hole: 115.5mm, 2nd hole to the 3rd hole: 115.5mm, 3rd hole to the right edge: 58.5mm.

Lower right (CapsLock Side) hole: 13mm to the bottom edge, 58.5mm to the right edge.
Lower left hole: 36mm to the left edge, 37.5mm to the bottom edge.
